## Experience

- **Invest Finanse Bank: junior-frontend developer, October 2024 - now**

    Redesigned and finalized key sections of the corporate website on the 1C-Bitrix platform. This has improved the usability and visual perception of the resource by customers. The layout was based on Figma layouts adaptively and cross-browser, and the interface was displayed correctly on all popular devices and browsers.

    Optimized the loading of the partner network's page by implementing the SPA architecture and using lazy-loading, which significantly reduced the time of the first rendering and increased the overall performance of the interface.
    
    Developed and implemented the partner network section in the administrative panel, which includes 8 subsections and a modal window system. This has significantly simplified the management of partner data and improved internal business processes. Implemented integration with back-end services via the REST API, ensuring stable operation of the client side and automation of a number of functions.
